Key Takeaways
Scaling is Essential: Different algorithms require different scaling approaches
Prevent Data Leakage: Always fit transformers on training data only
Domain Knowledge: Use domain expertise to create meaningful features
Pipeline Everything: Use scikit-learn pipelines for reproducible workflows
Validate Transformations: Always check the impact of transformations on model performance
Handle Missing Values: Address missing data before feature engineering
Feature Selection: Not all features improve model performance
Cross-Validation: Validate feature engineering choices using proper CV
This comprehensive approach to data transformation and feature engineering provides the foundation for building robust machine learning models that generalize well to new data.

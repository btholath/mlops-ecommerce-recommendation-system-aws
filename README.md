Step-by-Step Execution Instructions
# Step 1: Clone/Create project structure
git clone <your-repo> # or create manually
cd ecommerce-ml-project

# Step 2: Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Install the missing dependency
pip install fsspec
pip install fsspec s3fs pyarrow openpyxl

# Also install s3fs for better S3 integration
pip install s3fs

# Install boto3 with pandas extras
pip install boto3[crt] pandas[all]

# Step 4: Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format

# Step 5: Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values

# Step 6: Generate sample data
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py

# Step 7: Set up AWS infrastructure (optional, if you need to create resources)
python scripts/setup_aws_infrastructure.py

# Step 8: Upload sample data to S3
aws s3 cp data/sample/customers.csv s3://your-bucket/raw-data/customers/
aws s3 cp data/sample/products.csv s3://your-bucket/raw-data/products/
aws s3 cp data/sample/transactions.csv s3://your-bucket/raw-data/transactions/

# Step 9: Run the main pipeline
python main.py

# Step 10: Check logs
tail -f ecommerce_ml.log



# 11. Running Tests
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_data_preparation.py -v

# Run with coverage
pip install pytest-cov
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Data Transformation and Feature Engineering (Task Statement 1.2)
# Overview
Data transformation and feature engineering are critical steps in the machine learning pipeline that can significantly impact model performance. This involves converting raw data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms and creating meaningful features that help models learn patterns effectively.

# Core Concepts
- 1. Data Transformation Types
    - Scaling and Normalization
    - Min-Max Scaling: Scales features to a fixed range (usually 0-1)
    - Standardization (Z-score): Centers data around mean=0, std=1
    - Robust Scaling: Uses median and IQR, less sensitive to outliers
    - Unit Vector Scaling: Scales individual samples to have unit norm
- Encoding Categorical Variables
    - One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category
    - Label Encoding: Assigns numeric labels to categories
    - Target Encoding: Uses target variable statistics
    - Binary Encoding: Converts categories to binary representation
- Handling Skewed Data
    - Log Transformation: Reduces right skewness
    - Square Root Transformation: Mild skewness correction
    - Box-Cox Transformation: Parametric power transformation
    - Yeo-Johnson: Handles zero and negative values

Key Takeaways
Scaling is Essential: Different algorithms require different scaling approaches
Prevent Data Leakage: Always fit transformers on training data only
Domain Knowledge: Use domain expertise to create meaningful features
Pipeline Everything: Use scikit-learn pipelines for reproducible workflows
Validate Transformations: Always check the impact of transformations on model performance
Handle Missing Values: Address missing data before feature engineering
Feature Selection: Not all features improve model performance
Cross-Validation: Validate feature engineering choices using proper CV
This comprehensive approach to data transformation and feature engineering provides the foundation for building robust machine learning models that generalize well to new data.

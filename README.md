# mlops-ecommerce-recommendation-system-aws
End-to-end MLOps project on AWS to build a real-world e-commerce recommendation system. Covers all four domains of the AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer ‚Äì Associate exam: data preparation, model development, deployment &amp; orchestration, and ML solution monitoring.


This project implements a scalable, production-grade **e-commerce product recommendation system** using AWS Machine Learning services. It is designed to align with the four competency domains of the **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer ‚Äì Associate (MLA-C01)** exam:

- üßº **Domain 1: Data Preparation for ML (28%)**  
  Ingest and preprocess purchase, clickstream, and product metadata using SageMaker Processing and AWS Glue.

- üß† **Domain 2: ML Model Development (26%)**  
  Train collaborative filtering and deep learning models using SageMaker built-in algorithms and custom XGBoost/PyTorch scripts.

- üöÄ **Domain 3: Deployment and Orchestration (22%)**  
  Deploy models with SageMaker endpoints, orchestrate workflows using SageMaker Pipelines and Step Functions.

- üîç **Domain 4: Monitoring, Maintenance, and Security (24%)**  
  Monitor model drift and bias with SageMaker Model Monitor, secure infrastructure with IAM and encryption, and automate retraining.

This project runs from **VS Code** using the **AWS SDK (Boto3)**, and is deployable in the AWS cloud using real-world MLOps best practices.
